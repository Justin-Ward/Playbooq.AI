# Playbooq Development Chat Log

## Session Date: December 2024

---

## Initial Request
**User**: Can you load the prior chats so you have context? Also, my computer just crashed and interrupted some actions that you were doing.

**Assistant Response**: I understand you want me to load prior chat context and that your computer crashed while I was working on something. Let me search for any relevant information about what was happening before the crash.

**Actions Taken**:
- Searched codebase for recent changes
- Examined modified API endpoints
- Read key files to understand interrupted work
- Identified TypeScript errors in app/playbooks/page.tsx
- Found comprehensive playbook application with file processing capabilities

---

## Context Discovery
**Key Findings**:
- Working on playbook application with file processing (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Enhanced playbook management system (local + remote)
- PDF parser using pdf.js for client-side extraction
- API endpoints: `/api/generate-playbook` and `/api/process-files`
- TypeScript errors preventing compilation

**Files Modified**:
- app/api/generate-playbook/route.ts
- app/api/process-files/route.ts
- app/playbooks/page.tsx
- components/PlaybookGenerator.tsx
- And several others...

**New Files Added**:
- components/ContextMenu.tsx
- components/LoadingSkeleton.tsx
- components/PlaybookSidebar.tsx
- lib/hooks/useEnhancedPlaybookManager.ts
- lib/pdf-parser.ts
- lib/services/ directory

---

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: TypeScript errors in app/playbooks/page.tsx
- Line 107: Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'
- Line 118: Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
- Line 229: Same type issue
- Line 356: Same type issue

**Solution Applied**:
1. Changed `summary: null` to `summary: undefined`
2. Added null checks for `currentPlaybook.id` before function calls
3. Ensured proper type safety throughout the file

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
summary: null,

// After  
summary: undefined,

// Before
await updatePlaybook(currentPlaybook.id, {...})

// After
if (currentPlaybook.id) {
  await updatePlaybook(currentPlaybook.id, {...})
}
```
